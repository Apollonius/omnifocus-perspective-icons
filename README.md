# OmniFocus 2 Perspective Icons

By Josh Hughes

I've developed a set of icons that is specifically designed to work well with The Omni Group's OmniFocus 2 for Mac software (currently in public beta). Feel free to use these icons for whatever you like.

The production-ready icons are all in the "dist" folder. Each glyph has a file for each of the following colors: blue, brown, graphite, orange, purple, red, and teal. There are also Retina screen 2x variations.

The "src" folder contains PSDs of all the icons.

Feedback is welcome. I can be reached at josh@josh-hughes.com.
